# N-queen-problem-
N queen problem using DFS,hill climbing in python

Execute main1.py to obtaine the results
Then give no. of queens for DFS and hill climbing algorithm
No. of queens => 4 for a sensible result
After that you will be asked about the choice of algorithm which you want to execute
1: DFS
2: Hill Climbing
3: Both
DFS algorithm prints the solutions without ignoring symmetry.
Hill Climbing algorithm prints all possible solutions based upon random inititalization of queens
It gives moves,success,no. of steps as well
If there is no better solution then the algorithm prints "NULL"
1 represents the position of queen in both DFS and Hill Climbing Algorithm.
Also the developed script gives the time complexity for both methods
